# Button Highlighting Improvement

## Issue
The selected role buttons (User Mode / Professional Mode) were not clearly distinguishable when active, making it difficult for users to understand which mode was currently selected.

## Solution
Updated the active state styling to use a distinct color scheme that clearly differentiates selected from unselected buttons.

## Changes Made

### Before
```tsx
// Active state (selected)
'bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 text-gray-900 border-transparent shadow-lg font-semibold drop-shadow-sm'

// Inactive state (unselected)
'bg-white/50 text-gray-700 border-gray-200 hover:border-purple-300 hover:bg-white/80'
```

### After
```tsx
// Active state (selected)
'bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-cyan-500 text-white border-transparent shadow-lg font-semibold drop-shadow-sm'

// Inactive state (unselected)
'bg-white/50 text-gray-700 border-gray-200 hover:border-purple-300 hover:bg-white/80'
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Distinct Color Scheme**: Changed from purple/pink gradient to blue/cyan gradient for active state
2. **Better Contrast**: White text on blue background provides excellent readability
3. **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Selected buttons now stand out prominently from unselected ones
4. **Consistent Styling**: Maintained the same visual effects (shadow, drop-shadow, font-weight)

## Visual Result

- **Selected Button**: Bright blue-to-cyan gradient with white text, clearly indicating active state
- **Unselected Button**: Transparent white background with gray text, subtle and unobtrusive
- **Hover Effects**: Maintained purple accent on hover for unselected buttons

## User Experience

Users can now immediately identify which mode is selected, improving the overall usability of the chat interface. The blue gradient provides a modern, professional look while ensuring excellent accessibility and readability.

**The role selection buttons now provide clear visual feedback for the selected state!** ðŸŽ¯
