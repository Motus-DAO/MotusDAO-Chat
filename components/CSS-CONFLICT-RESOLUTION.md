# CSS Conflict Resolution

## Issue
The role selection buttons (User Mode / Professional Mode) were not displaying the correct styling when selected. The text was not visible and the buttons were not showing the expected blue gradient background.

## Root Cause
A global CSS rule in `app/globals.css` was interfering with button styling:

```css
* { border-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.45); }
```

This rule was setting all border colors to a very light white, which was overriding the button's intended styling.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Global CSS Conflict
Removed the problematic global rule from `app/globals.css`:
```diff
- /* Remove any legacy borders/outlines that were added globally */
- * { border-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.45); }
```

### 2. Implemented Inline Styles
Updated the button styling in `app/chat/page.tsx` to use inline styles for the active state:

```tsx
style={role === 'user' ? {
  background: 'linear-gradient(to right, #3b82f6, #06b6d4)',
  color: 'white',
  borderColor: 'transparent',
  textShadow: '0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'
} : {}}
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Eliminated CSS Conflicts**: Removed the global rule that was interfering with button styling
2. **Inline Style Approach**: Used inline styles to ensure styles are applied with highest specificity
3. **Better Visual Feedback**: Selected buttons now clearly show blue gradient background with white text
4. **Enhanced Readability**: Added text shadow for better contrast and readability

## Visual Result

- **Selected Button**: Bright blue-to-cyan gradient with white text and text shadow
- **Unselected Button**: Transparent white background with gray text
- **Clear Distinction**: Users can immediately see which mode is active

## Technical Details

- **CSS Specificity**: Inline styles have the highest specificity and override external CSS
- **Gradient Colors**: Blue (#3b82f6) to Cyan (#06b6d4) for modern, professional appearance
- **Text Shadow**: Subtle shadow (0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)) for enhanced readability
- **Border Handling**: Transparent border to avoid conflicts with global border rules

## User Experience

The role selection buttons now provide immediate and clear visual feedback, making it obvious which mode (User Mode or Professional Mode) is currently selected. The blue gradient creates a modern, professional appearance while ensuring excellent accessibility and readability.

**The CSS conflicts have been resolved and the buttons now display correctly!** ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
